        <h1>Career</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            Bhatt had her first leading role in 2012 with Karan Johar's teen film Student of the Year, alongside Sidharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan.<br> She auditioned alongside 500 girls and was cast after losing 16 kg.<br> She played a sophisticated
            teenage girl involved in a love triangle.<br> Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times mentioned similarities between her character Shanaya Singhania and Kareena Kapoor's Pooja "Poo" Sharma in Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), but noted
            that her performance was "without the killer attitude".<br> Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter dismissed her as "a washout. Not only is she inelegant in the dance numbers, but her expressions are limited; and the digital retouching of
            her face throughout the film is a distraction".<br> Student of the Year grossed ₹960 million (US$13 million) at the box office, becoming a commercial success.
