        <div class="intro">
            Dhawan made his acting debut in 2012 with Johar's romantic comedy drama Student of the Year alongside Sidharth Malhotra and Alia Bhatt.<br> He was confident as Rohan Nanda, the teenage son of a rich businessman, who competes with his girlfriend
            Shanaya (Bhatt) and best friend Abhimanyu Singh (Malhotra) to win an annual school championship.<br> Film critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama found Dhawan to be "a talent one can't help but marvel at" and CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand added:
            "It's Varun Dhawan who stands out with a confident, charming turn, able to tackle both comical and vulnerable scenes with ease".<br> Student of the Year was a success, grossing ₹970 million (US$14 million) worldwide, and Dhawan's performance
            earned him a Best Male Debut nomination at Filmfare.<br> Following a year long absence from the screen, similar to that of co-stars Bhatt and Malhotra who had their second releases before him in 2014, Dhawan appeared in two films, the first
            of which was the romantic comedy Main Tera Hero (2014), a remake of the Telugu film Kandireega, which was produced by Balaji Motion Pictures and directed by his father David.<br> He played Sreenath "Seenu" Prasad, an impetuous brat who is
            involved in a love triangle between his true love interest Sunaina Goradia, played by Ileana D'Cruz, and his one-sided lover Ayesha Singhal, the daughter of a dreaded gangster-cum-don, played by Nargis Fakhri.<br> Raedita Tandon of Filmfare

            dance film ABCD: Any Body Can Dance, titled Disney's ABCD 2, in which he portrayed the real-life character of Kings United India founder Suresh Mukund, a dancer from Mumbai who went on to win the 2012 World Hip Hop Dance Championship.<br>            Critic Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters criticised the feature, finding Dhawan to be the only asset of the film, writing that "except for the honest note he strikes, the rest of the film could have been just a bunch of music videos".<br> ABCD
            2 earned ₹1.57 billion (US$22 million) worldwide; the film's commercial performance led Box Office India to consider it an emergence of Dhawan's star power; he and Kapoor were eventually the only actors among their contemporaries to star in
            a live-action Disney film.[29] His final appearance that year was in Rohit Shetty's ensemble action drama Dilwale, co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Kriti Sanon, in which he played the younger sibling of Khan's character, as well as Sanon's
            love interest.<br> Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film proved to be a commercial success, grossing over ₹3.75 billion (US$53 million), emerging as Dhawan's highest-grossing release and one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films.
